`gitweb` is a command line interface I created mainly to learn Rust.

## Usage

`gitweb` will by default open the remote in the browser of the current
repository.

```
gitweb 0.1.0
Yoann Fleury <yoann.fleury@yahoo.com>
Open the current remote repository in your browser

USAGE:
    gitweb.exe [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v, --verbose    Set the verbosity of the command

OPTIONS:
    -b, --branch <branch>      Set the branch
    -B, --browser <browser>    Set the browser
```

## --branch

`gitweb` will open the current branch on the remote repository. You can override
the behavior by giving the `--branch` flag with the custom branch you want to
open in the browser.

## --browser

`gitweb` tries to start one of the following browser (in that order of priority):

- `$BROWSER` on Linux üêß or `%BROWSER%` on Windows üèÅ (this is a non standard variable)
- `--browser` option given in the command line
- the default web browser on the system
