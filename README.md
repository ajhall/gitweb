# gitweb

`gitweb` is a command line interface I created mainly to learn Rust.

# TODO

- [ ] define the default behavior of the command.
- [ ] add an option `--help` to tell the user how to use the command line
- [ ] add `--branch` option (I think that C. Delafarge) did a good talk about
      Rust, and how to handle parameters at Devoxx 2018.
- [ ] add an option `--file` to specify the file to open.
- [ ] make sure to handle gitlab/github/bitbucket
